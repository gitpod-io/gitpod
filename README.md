Gitpod is an open-source Kubernetes application providing fully-baked, collaborative development environments in your browser - powered by VS Code. 

Tightly integrated with GitLab, GitHub, and Bitbucket, Gitpod automatically and continuously prebuilds dev environments for all your branches. As a result, team members can instantly start coding with fresh, ephemeral and fully-compiled dev environments - no matter if you are building a new feature, want to fix a bug or do a code review.

During the development of Gitpod we had to also develop our own tooling infrastructure to make development easier and more efficient.
To this extend we've developed a number of open source projects including [Werft](https://github.com/csweichel/werft), [Leeway](https://github.com/TypeFox/leeway), and [Dazzle](https://github.com/csweichel/dazzle/).
