# Gitpod - Ready-to-Code Development Environments for GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket

[Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) provides instant dev environments for any GitHub project in your browser.

Simply prefix any GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket URL with `gitpod.io/#`.

## How to use Gitpod?

You can use Gitpod to simplify contributions for your repository, so people can code on your project with a single click.
Just add the following markdown code to your Readme:
```md
[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/<org>/<repo>)
```

Here's an example opening the project for the Theia IDE:
