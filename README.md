Gitpod is an open-source Kubernetes application for automated and ready-to-code development environments that blends in your existing workflow. It enables you to describe your dev environment as code and start instant and fresh development environments for each new task directly from your browser.

Tightly integrated with GitLab, GitHub, and Bitbucket, Gitpod automatically and continuously prebuilds dev environments for all your branches. As a result, team members can instantly start coding with fresh, ephemeral and fully-compiled dev environments - no matter if you are building a new feature, want to fix a bug or do a code review.

## Features

üèó [Dev environments as code](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/#-dev-environments-as-code) - Gitpod applies lessons learned from infrastructure-as-code. Spinning up dev environments is easily repeatable and reproducible empowering you to automate, version-control and share dev environments across your team.

‚ö°Ô∏è [Prebuilt dev environments](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/#prebuilds) - Gitpod continuously prebuilds all your git branches similar to a CI server. Control how Gitpod pre-configures and initializes environments before you even start a workspace through `init` commands in your `.gitpod.yml`.

üê≥ [Integrated Docker build](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/config-docker/) - Gitpod instantly starts a container in the cloud based on your Docker image. Tools that are required for your project are easy to install and configure.

üëê [GitLab, GitHub, and Bitbucket integration](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/integrations/) - Gitpod seamlessly integrates in your workflow and works with all major git hosting platforms including GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket.

üëÄ [Integrated code reviews](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/code-reviews/#code-reviews) - with Gitpod you can do native code reviews on any PR/MR. No need to switch context anymore and clutter your local machine with your colleagues PR/MR.

üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è [Collaboration](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/sharing-and-collaboration/) - invite team members to your dev environment or snapshot any state of your dev environment to share it with your team asynchronously.

üõ† Professional & customizable developer experience - a Gitpod workspace gives you the same capabilities (yes, even [root & docker](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/feature-preview/#root-access)) as your Linux machine - pre-configured and optimized for your individual development workflow. Install any [VS Code extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/vscode-extensions/) with one click on a user and/or team level.

During the development of Gitpod we also developed some our own infrastructure tooling to make development easier and more efficient.
To this end we've developed a number of open source projects including:

1. [**Werft**](https://github.com/csweichel/werft) - A Kubernetes native CI system
1. [**Leeway**](https://github.com/gitpod-io/leeway) - A heavily caching build system
1. [**Dazzle**](https://github.com/gitpod-io/dazzle/) - An experimental Docker image builder
