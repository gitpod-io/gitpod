  - id: CVE-2022-33171
    paths:
      - "app/node_modules/typeorm/package.json"
    statement: |
      This vulnerability in TypeORM's findOne / findOneOrFail functions can improperly interpret a crafted JSON object
      and concatenate it into raw SQL, potentially allowing SQL injection attacks.

      In Gitpodâ€™s usage, TypeORM is not exposed to arbitrary user input. For example, DB migrations run preset queries;
      the server/bridge code does not hand raw JSON from external sources to findOne. Therefore, there is no path for
      injecting malicious JSON into a query, rendering the vulnerability non-exploitable.
