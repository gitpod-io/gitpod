  steps: |
    1. On the dashboard go to "Environment Variables" in the menu
    2. Click the `+` button and use `testvar` as name, `foobar` as value and `gitpod-io/*` as repo pattern
    3. Click the `+` button and use `notpresent` as name, `foobar` as value and `doesnotexist/*` as repo pattern
    4. Start a workspace with https://gitpod-staging.com/#passedin=test%20value/https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod-test-repo
    5. In the workspace run:
        - `env | grep testvar` to verify that `testvar == foobar`
        - `env | grep notpresent` to verify that `notpresent` is not present
        - `env | grep passedin` to verify that `passedin == "test value"`
        - `gp env` to verify that only `testvar` is found
        - `gp env another=value && gp env | grep another` to verify that setting env vars works
        - `gp env another=differentValue && gp env | grep another` to verify that overriding env vars works
        - `gp env -u another && gp env | grep another` to verify that unsetting env vars works
    6. In the dashboard's "environment variables" section delete `testvar`
    7. In the workspace run `gp env | grep testvar` to verify that the variable was deleted
    8. In the dashboard's "environment variables" section add a new variable and use `testvar` as name, `newvalue` as value and `gitpod-io/*` as repo pattern
    9. In the workspace run `gp env | grep testvar` to verify that the new version of `testvar` was created
    10. Stop the workspace, wait until it is stopped and re-start that very same workspace
    11. In the restarted workspace run:
        - `env | grep testvar` to verify that `testvar == newvalue`
        - `env | grep passedin` to verify that `passedin == "test value"`
