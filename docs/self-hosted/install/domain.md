# Domain

Gitpod requires a domain resolvable by some nameserver (typically a public domain name, e.g. `your-domain.com`).
As Gitpod launches services and workspaces on additional subdomains it also needs two wildcard domains.
For example:

    your-domain.com
    *.your-domain.com
    *.ws.your-domain.com

Installing Gitpod on a subdomain works as well. For example:

    gitpod.your-domain.com
    *.gitpod.your-domain.com
    *.ws.gitpod.your-domain.com
