> Since the `0.6.0` release (December 2020) the installers have been deprecated and have been removed with the `0.9.0` release (April 2021).

We currently [do not support AWS as platform](https://www.notion.so/gitpod/1b9eac5cb33d42e391f86a87f0e37836?v=4f2ec7c943514ee19203b9d4fe096094) for running Gitpod.

You still might get Gitpod to run on AWS (especially with the help of our [awesome community](https://community.gitpod.io/)) but there will be no support from Gitpod for those efforts.
