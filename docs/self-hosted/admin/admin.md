# Administrate Gitpod Self-Hosted

While we are working on the administration experience, there is already a lot you can do if you know where to look.

Workpaces are stored as tar files in Minio or Google Storage buckets (depending on your configuration).
The tar files can be downloaded from there and unpacked locally.


## List all running workspaces

`SELECT`....

`kubectl get pods`

## Stop a running workspace

`kubectl delete pod`


## Connect to built-in Registry
