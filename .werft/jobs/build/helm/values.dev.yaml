# we hit the "max. 110 pods/node" situation pretty often with our current core-dev setup.
# the proper way to fix those would be to adjust the CIDR for workload NodePool which is a bit more work.
# as a workaround, we blow up our RAM requests to trigger scaleup earlier.
# Note: This only works because we tune down our DaemonSet's requests to near-0 (because DS pods don't trigger scalups!)
resources:
  default:
    # as opposed to 200Mi, the default
    # we make static pods big enough so that 100 pods fill up the whole node (we ignore other DaemonSets here because they are quite small),
    # and assume not all envs carry workspaces all the time:
    # => 32Gi / 100 ~ 328Mi => 350Mi
