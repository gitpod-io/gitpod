/**
 * The WorkspaceInstance lifecycle is split between application clusters and workspace clusters on the transition from
 * pending/building -> starting (cmp. WorkspacePhases here:
 * https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/blob/008ea3fadc89d4817cf3effc8a5b30eaf469fb1c/components/gitpod-protocol/src/workspace-instance.ts#L111).
 *
 * Before the transition, WorkspaceInstances belong to the respective app cluster, denoted by "instance.region === 'eu02'", for exmaple.
 * After a WorkspaceInstance has been moved over to a workspace cluster, that moved "ownership" is reflected in said field.
 * We maintain a constant connection (called "bridge") to all workspace clusters to be able to keep reality (workspace
 * side) in sync with what we have in our DB/forward to clients.
 *
 * This class is meant to take the same responsibility for all WorkspaceInstances that have not (yet) been passed over
 * to a workspace cluster for whatever reason. Here's a list of examples, prefixed by phase:
 *  - "preparing": failed cleanup after failed call to wsManager.StartWorkspace
 *  - "building": failed cleanup after failed image-build (which is still controlled by the application cluster,
 *     although that might change in the future)
