/**
 * This enables UI-experiments: Dashboard-local changes that we'd like to try out and get some feedback on/validate
 * our assumptions on via mixpanel before we roll them out to everyone. The motivation is to make UI development more
 * data-driven then the current approach.
 *
 * An experiment is supposed to:
 *  - only be applied to a subset of users, so we are guaranteed to always have a control group (configurable per experiment)
 *  - is dashboard/component local: it's not a mechnanism to cross the API boundary, mostly even component-local
 *  - is stable per session/client
 *  - is defined in code (see below): adding/deprecating experiments requires a deployment
 * It is NOT supposed to:
 *  - big a way to roll-out big, completly new features
 *  - have a lot of different experiments in parallel (too noisy)
 *
 * Questions:
 *  - multiple experiments per user/time
