## gitpod-cli

All of the accessible commands can be listed with `gitpod --help` .

### Installing

1. Download the CLI for your platform and make it executable:

```bash
wget -O gitpod https://gitpod.io/static/bin/gitpod-cli-darwin-arm64
chmod u+x gitpod
```

2. Optionally, make it available globally. On macOS:

```bash
sudo mv gitpod /usr/local/bin/
```

### Usage

Start by logging in with `gitpod login`, which will also create a default context in the configuration file (`~/.gitpod/config.yaml`).

### Development

To develop the CLI with Gitpod, you can run it just like locally, but in Gitpod workspaces, a browser and a keyring are not available. To log in despite these limitations, provide a PAT via the `GITPOD_TOKEN` environment variable, or use the `--token` flag with the login command.

#### In a Gitpod workspace

[![Open in Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/svg/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod)

You will have gitpod-cli ready as `gitpod` on any Workspace based on `https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod`.

```
# Reinstall `gitpod`
leeway run components/local-app:install-cli

# Reinstall completion
leeway run components/local-app:cli-completion
```

### Versioning and Release Management

The CLI is versioned independently of other Gitpod artifacts due to its auto-updating behaviour.
To create a new version that existing clients will consume increment the number in `version.txt`. Make sure to use semantic versioning. The minor version can be greater than 10, e.g. `0.342` is a valid version.

**Beware**: this is very much work in progress and will likely break things.
