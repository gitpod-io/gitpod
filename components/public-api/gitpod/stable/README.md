# Gitpod Stable API
This package contains definitions for Stable APIs as per our [definition of the package structure](../../README.md).

## Adding or extending APIs (internally)
Changes to the stable APIs require an API User Experience review. If you're looking to extend the API, discuss it first in #feature-public-api.
