# Project Brief: Gitpod

## Overview
Gitpod is a developer platform that provides on-demand, pre-configured development environments that automatically integrate with any tool, library, or dependency required for creating software. It enables developers to spin up fresh, automated dev environments for each task, in the cloud, in seconds.

## Core Features
- **Dev Environments as Code**: Define editor extensions and dependencies in a declarative `.gitpod.yml` configuration
- **Prebuilt Dev Environments**: Continuously prebuilds all git branches similar to a CI server
- **Security**: Each workspace runs on a secured single-use container
- **Docker-based Workspaces**: Instantly starts a container in the cloud based on a Docker image
- **Git Platform Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps
- **Integrated Code Reviews**: Native code reviews on any PR/MR
- **Collaboration**: Invite team members to your dev environment or share snapshots
- **Customizable Developer Experience**: Same capabilities as a Linux machine, pre-configured and optimized

## Project Goals
1. Provide instant, ready-to-code development environments
2. Eliminate environment setup and maintenance overhead
3. Enable consistent development experiences across teams
4. Improve collaboration and code review workflows
5. Enhance security through containerized environments
6. Support a wide range of development workflows and technologies

## Target Audience
- Software developers and development teams
- Open source contributors
- Educational institutions
- Enterprise development organizations

## Project Scope
Gitpod encompasses:
- Cloud-based development environment infrastructure
- IDE integration (VS Code, JetBrains)
- Git platform integrations
- Prebuild and caching systems
- Collaboration tools
- Self-hosted and managed deployment options

This project brief serves as the foundation for all other memory bank documents and defines the core requirements and goals of Gitpod.
