# Progress: Gitpod

## Current Status

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Memory Bank | Initial setup complete with core files and component documentation |
| Codebase Understanding | Basic overview with detailed understanding of key components |
| Component Documentation | 33 service components and 11 API components documented |
| Development Environment | Not yet configured |
| Task Identification | Not yet started |

## What Works

### Our Contributions
- Memory bank structure with comprehensive documentation
- Documentation for 33 service components and 11 API components
- Server readiness probe implementation with database, SpiceDB, and Redis checks
- Standardized development workflows (PRD process)

### Existing Platform Functionality
| Category | Features |
|----------|----------|
| **Core** | • Git-based workspaces<br>• IDE integration (VS Code, JetBrains)<br>• Prebuild system<br>• Git platform integrations<br>• Containerized workspaces<br>• Collaboration features |
| **Infrastructure** | • Leeway build system<br>• Kubernetes deployment<br>• Microservices architecture<br>• Testing frameworks |

## What's Left to Build

### Immediate Tasks
- Explore component interactions
- Set up local development environment
- Explore build system approaches
- Test component builds
- Identify components for deeper exploration
- Establish testing methodology
- Create initial contribution plan

## Known Issues
No specific issues identified yet. Potential areas of concern:
