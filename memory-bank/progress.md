# Progress: Gitpod

## Current Status

As of the memory bank initialization, we are at the beginning of our work with the Gitpod codebase. The current status is:

- **Memory Bank**: Initial setup complete
- **Codebase Understanding**: Basic overview obtained
- **Development Environment**: Not yet configured
- **Task Identification**: Not yet started

## What Works

Since we are just beginning our work with Gitpod, this section primarily reflects the existing functionality of the Gitpod platform rather than our specific contributions:

### Core Functionality
- Workspace creation from Git repositories
- IDE integration (VS Code, JetBrains)
- Prebuild system for faster startup
- Git platform integrations (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps)
- Containerized workspaces with Docker support
- Collaborative features

### Development Infrastructure
- Leeway build system for component management
- Kubernetes-based deployment
- Microservices architecture
- Testing frameworks

## What's Left to Build

This section will be updated as specific tasks and improvements are identified. Initially, it serves as a placeholder for tracking future work:

### Immediate Tasks
- Set up local development environment
- Identify specific components for deeper exploration
- Establish testing methodology
- Create initial contribution plan

### Future Improvements
This section will be populated as we identify specific improvements or features to implement.

## Known Issues

As we begin working with the codebase, we have not yet identified specific issues. This section will be updated as issues are discovered during development and testing.

### Potential Areas of Concern
- Component coupling and dependencies
- Build system complexity
- Testing coverage
- Documentation completeness

## Milestones

### Completed Milestones
- Memory bank initialization (Current)

### Upcoming Milestones
- Development environment setup
- First component deep dive
- Initial contribution
- First feature implementation

## Metrics and Progress Indicators

As we progress, we'll track various metrics to gauge our progress and effectiveness:

- **Code Understanding**: Percentage of components with detailed documentation
- **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests
- **Issue Resolution**: Number of issues identified and resolved
- **Feature Implementation**: Number of features successfully implemented
- **Documentation Quality**: Completeness and accuracy of memory bank

## Blockers and Dependencies

No specific blockers or dependencies have been identified yet. This section will be updated as we encounter any obstacles that impede progress.

## Recent Progress

- **2/26/2025**: Memory bank initialized with core documentation files

## Next Evaluation Point

The next evaluation of progress will occur after:
1. Setting up the development environment
2. Completing the first deep dive into a specific component
3. Identifying initial tasks for contribution

At that point, this document will be updated to reflect new findings and progress.
