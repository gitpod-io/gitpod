# Progress: Gitpod

## Current Status

We are in the early stages of our work with the Gitpod codebase. The current status is:

- **Memory Bank**: Initial setup complete with core files and component documentation
- **Codebase Understanding**: Basic overview obtained, with detailed understanding of key components
- **Component Documentation**: Documentation created for 12 key components
- **Development Environment**: Not yet configured
- **Task Identification**: Not yet started

## What Works

Our current contributions:
- Memory bank structure established
- Component documentation for:
  - blobserve
  - content-service
  - dashboard
  - ws-manager-mk2
  - supervisor
  - ws-daemon
  - ide-service
  - registry-facade
  - image-builder-mk3
  - server
  - proxy
  - ws-proxy

The existing functionality of the Gitpod platform:

### Core Functionality
- Workspace creation from Git repositories
- IDE integration (VS Code, JetBrains)
- Prebuild system for faster startup
- Git platform integrations (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps)
- Containerized workspaces with Docker support
- Collaborative features

### Development Infrastructure
- Leeway build system for component management
- Kubernetes-based deployment
- Microservices architecture
- Testing frameworks

## What's Left to Build

### Immediate Tasks
- Explore component interactions
- Set up local development environment
- Identify specific components for deeper exploration
- Establish testing methodology
- Create initial contribution plan

### Future Improvements
This section will be populated as we identify specific improvements or features to implement.

## Known Issues

As we begin working with the codebase, we have not yet identified specific issues. This section will be updated as issues are discovered during development and testing.

### Potential Areas of Concern
- Component coupling and dependencies
- Build system complexity
- Testing coverage
- Documentation completeness

## Milestones

### Completed Milestones
- Memory bank initialization
- Component documentation structure
- Documentation of first set of key components (blobserve, content-service, dashboard, ws-manager-mk2)
- Documentation of second set of key components (supervisor, ws-daemon)
- Documentation of third set of key components (ide-service, registry-facade, image-builder-mk3)
- Documentation of fourth set of key components (server, proxy, ws-proxy)

### Upcoming Milestones
- Documentation of remaining key components
- Development environment setup
- First component deep dive
- Initial contribution
- First feature implementation

## Metrics and Progress Indicators

As we progress, we'll track various metrics to gauge our progress and effectiveness:

- **Code Understanding**: Percentage of components with detailed documentation
- **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests
- **Issue Resolution**: Number of issues identified and resolved
- **Feature Implementation**: Number of features successfully implemented
- **Documentation Quality**: Completeness and accuracy of memory bank

## Blockers and Dependencies

No specific blockers or dependencies have been identified yet. This section will be updated as we encounter any obstacles that impede progress.

## Recent Progress

- **2/26/2025**:
  - Memory bank initialized with core documentation files
  - Created components subdirectory in memory bank
  - Documented blobserve component
  - Documented content-service component
  - Documented dashboard component
  - Documented ws-manager-mk2 component
  - Documented supervisor component
  - Documented ws-daemon component
  - Documented ide-service component
  - Documented registry-facade component
  - Documented image-builder-mk3 component
  - Documented server component
  - Documented proxy component
  - Documented ws-proxy component

## Next Evaluation Point

The next evaluation of progress will occur after:
1. Setting up the development environment
2. Completing the first deep dive into a specific component
3. Identifying initial tasks for contribution

At that point, this document will be updated to reflect new findings and progress.
