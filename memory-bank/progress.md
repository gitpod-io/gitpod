The existing functionality of the Gitpod platform:

### Core Functionality
- Workspace creation from Git repositories
- IDE integration (VS Code, JetBrains)
- Prebuild system for faster startup
- Git platform integrations (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps)
- Containerized workspaces with Docker support
- Collaborative features

### Development Infrastructure
- Leeway build system for component management
- Kubernetes-based deployment
- Microservices architecture
- Testing frameworks

## What's Left to Build

### Immediate Tasks
- Explore component interactions
- Set up local development environment
- Explore build system approaches (in-tree and Leeway)
- Test component builds for different component types
- Identify specific components for deeper exploration
- Establish testing methodology
- Create initial contribution plan

### Future Improvements
This section will be populated as we identify specific improvements or features to implement.

## Known Issues

As we begin working with the codebase, we have not yet identified specific issues. This section will be updated as issues are discovered during development and testing.

### Potential Areas of Concern
- Component coupling and dependencies
- Build system complexity
- Testing coverage
- Documentation completeness

## Metrics and Progress Indicators

As we progress, we'll track various metrics to gauge our progress and effectiveness:

- **Code Understanding**: Percentage of components with detailed documentation
- **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests
- **Issue Resolution**: Number of issues identified and resolved
- **Feature Implementation**: Number of features successfully implemented
- **Documentation Quality**: Completeness and accuracy of memory bank

## Blockers and Dependencies
