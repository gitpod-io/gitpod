# Product Context: Gitpod

## Why Gitpod Exists
Gitpod addresses development environment inconsistency and setup time challenges through ephemeral, automated cloud environments.

### Key Challenges Solved
| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Environment Inconsistency | Eliminates "works on my machine" problems |
| Onboarding Friction | Reduces new team member setup from days to seconds |
| Context Switching | Minimizes project switching overhead |
| Resource Limitations | Overcomes local machine constraints |
| Configuration Drift | Prevents environments from becoming inconsistent |

## Value Proposition by Stakeholder

| Stakeholder | Benefits |
|-------------|----------|
| **Individual Developers** | • Zero environment setup/maintenance<br>• Consistent environments<br>• Device-agnostic development<br>• Unlimited resources<br>• Effortless project switching |
| **Teams** | • Identical environments<br>• Rapid onboarding<br>• Enhanced collaboration<br>• Streamlined code reviews<br>• Reduced infrastructure overhead |
| **Organizations** | • Improved security<br>• Increased productivity<br>• Standardized tooling<br>• Remote work enablement<br>• Hardware cost reduction |

## How Gitpod Works
1. **Define**: Environment specified in `.gitpod.yml`
2. **Prebuild**: Environments prepared in advance (CI-like)
3. **Start**: Container spins up with prebuild results
4. **Develop**: Work in familiar IDE (VS Code, JetBrains)
5. **Collaborate**: Share workspaces and snapshots
6. **Integrate**: Seamless Git platform workflow
