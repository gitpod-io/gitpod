# Contributed Software

Software in this folder is likely unmaintained. Although these pieces are available as part of the official Gitpod source tree, they are in somewhat different status.  The intention is to keep interesting tools here, maybe even experimental ones, to give users an easier access to them, and to give tools wider exposure, so that they can be improved faster.
