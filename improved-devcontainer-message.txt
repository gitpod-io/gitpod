# Improved DevContainer Error Message

## Current message:
"failed to start dev container, see logs for details"

## Improved message:
"DevContainer configuration failed to apply. Using a basic recovery environment instead. Your custom tools and extensions may be unavailable."

## Alternative (shorter version):
"Using basic recovery environment. Custom tools unavailable. See logs for details."

## Explanation:
The improved message:
1. Clearly states what happened (DevContainer failed)
2. Explains what's happening now (using recovery environment)
3. Sets expectations for the user (custom tools unavailable)
4. Uses plain language without internal terminology
5. Is concise enough for a UI error message
6. Accurately describes the recovery container scenario

This message helps users understand:
- Their workspace is still usable (just in a limited way)
- Their custom configuration didn't apply
- They need to check logs for more details if they want to fix the issue
