    # Dashboard serves static assets, most of which ca be cached agressively because they are unique per version:
    # Their content hash is included in the path. Those are served under /static.
    location /static {
        add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000";

        proxy_pass http://dashboard$request_uri;

    # Other assets may change over time. Especially during deployment those might get invalidated within a short time frame.
    # Thus we want clients to check if their cached versions are still up-to-date on each request.
    # nginx by default sets 'etag' and 'last-modified' header (based on content hash and ctime/mtime).

    # # Cache-Control

    # The last modified header is set to the ctime/mtime of the respective file (which is the time our images are build).
    # This leads to clients that think their cached files are newer than ours because often we have several days/hours between build and actual deployment.
    # We could set "Last-Modified" to the deployment data, but would needlessly invalidate _all_ resources with each deployment.
    #
    # We want browsers to rely on etag only, as that is our ground truth. Delete "Last-Modified".
