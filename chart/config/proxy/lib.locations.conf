    # ### Caching
    # Dashboard only servces static resources, which should be cached agressively.
    # But on deployment those should be invalidated within a short time frame.
    # nginx by default sets 'etag' and 'last-modified' header (based on content hash and ctime/mtime).
    #
    # # Cache-Control
    # https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control
    # https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching#Cache_validation
    #
    # We want the browsers to revalidate each resource each time it uses it to ensure it always has the newest state.
    add_header Cache-Control "no-cache, no-transform";
    #
    # # Last-Modified
    # The last modified header is set to the ctime/mtime of the respective file (which is the time our images are build).
    # This leads to clients that think their cached files are newer than ours because often we have several days/hours between build and actual deployment.
    # We could set "Last-Modified" to the deployment data, but would needlessly invalidate _all_ resources with each deployment.
    #
    # We want browsers to rely on etag only, as that is our ground truth. Delete "Last-Modified".
    add_header "Last-Modified" "";

    # Let's redirect the browser agent to the web app, if no resources are found in the locations specified here.

    # was appearently caused by Twitter's link shortening. So, if the leading www is missing
    # in the URL by accident, we will redirect to the web on 404 – Not Found.
