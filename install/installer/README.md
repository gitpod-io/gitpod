# Installer

The best way to get started with Gitpod is by using our recommended & default installation method [described in our documentation](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/self-hosted/latest/installing-gitpod). In fact, our default installation method actually wraps this installer into a UI that helps you manage, update and configure Gitpod in a streamlined way.

> The installer is an internal tool and as such not expected to be used by those external to Gitpod. Instructions for how to use it can be found in the [docs](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/tree/main/install/installer/docs/overview.md) folder of this repo.
