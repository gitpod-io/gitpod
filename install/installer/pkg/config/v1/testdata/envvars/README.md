# Envvars

This test is designed to ensure that the environment variables create the expected
configuration file.

- create a new directory with a descriptive test name
- create an `envvars.yaml` file - this contains a map of the environment variables that will be loaded for your test
- create an `expect.yaml` file - this contains the config YAML that you expect to be generated by the test

## Example envvars.yaml

```yaml
envvars:
    DOMAIN: gitpod.io
```

## Example expect.yaml

```yaml
domain: gitpod.io
```

This does not require the factory/default values that will be generated automatically
