==================================
=== Gitpod Installation Status ===
==================================

This deployment checks if Gitpod has been installed to your
cluster successfully. If this deployment is running then
Gitpod has installed successfully.

If this deployment is in a failed state, it means that
either your Gitpod installation is still in progress or
that the installation job has failed.

If this deployment is in a failed state, it is almost
certainly a symptom of a problem elsewhere and not the
root cause.

The Gitpod installation job has failed. You can either:
 - go to the "Troubleshoot" section in the KOTS
   dashboard and run through the tests in there
 - redeploy Gitpod in the KOTS dashboard and watch
   the logs. The command for that is:
   "kubectl logs -f -n ${NAMESPACE} -l component=gitpod-installer --tail=-1"

To access the KOTS dashboard, you may need to run
"kubectl kots admin-console -n ${NAMESPACE}"
